This is a Perl module that implements the Minecraft client protocol. However:

 1. It is not finished.

 2. It may never support 64-bit integers, not any floating point values. These
    are difficult to support, at least without non-core modules.

 3. My particular needs are only to support logging in, idling, then logging
    back out. (This is used to implement waypoints with an SMP wrapper like 
	tztk.)
